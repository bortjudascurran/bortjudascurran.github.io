<b><u>A PROPOSAL FOR MARKET STRATEGIZATION AND PRODUCT ENGINEERING IN RESPONSE TO IMMINENT DEVELOPMENTS IN TECHNOLOGY</u></b> - <a title= "click me!" href="javascript:norah()">BY NORAH CURRAN</a></h2>

<p>For the last year and a half, I have been working as a social media coordinator for the Adelphi University Honors College. My previous roles at Adelphi and otherwise include copywriter, yearbook writer, and livestream camera operator. In addition to Digital Production, I am an Interdisciplinary Studies major. Beginning in my third year, I engineered my courseload and undertook <a title= "click me!" href="https://curranmultimedia7.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">several independent research projects</a> on the topic of technoetics, or computer/machine consciousness. The Honors College in particular has been an extremely nurturing place for myself, introducing me to new cultural perspectives, strengthening my argumentative writing, and supporting my inquiry into questions of the future that might seem at first to be abstract, idealistic, or improbable.</p>
    
<p>Come Spring Break, a successor for my position as social media coordinator will be chosen. I have been meditating upon what I can leave for my successors that truly accounts for what I see– given my course of study– as the shaping of our being-ness through social media. </p>
    
<p>Put simply, my philosophical approach to the Honors College social media platform has been that it is in itself a kind of collective consciousness– a memory belonging to no one but the many inhabitants of our physical space. But, as I am writing in 2024, I am certain that very soon the flux state of "the social media platform" itself will accelerate exponentially. 
    
<p>With the sale of Twitter/X to Elon Musk, we have seen a microcosm of how rapidly the apps themselves can change. These changes will be both highly visible such as the integration of the Grok AI into X, and more subtly cultural such as discourses produced by changes in content moderation standards. We social media coordinators can anticipate that new features will be developed for the apps we call home at a faster and faster rate. To adapt, we will have to focus on our capability to intuitively understand new interfaces and their ways of communication. In 2024, this looks like having a trained eye for trends and memes, such as my "How often does Dr. Carson think of the Roman Empire?" Instagram story. It will look unimaginably different a decade from now. I cannot emphasize this enough: we will have to become technologically adaptable beings.</p> 

<p>For this reason, I leave one message for my successors of the social media internship at Adelphi University, which I will expound upon to its furthest extent in this article: <span style= "font-style: italic;"> as soon as it is possible, you must upload yourself, at least in part, into a computer.</span></p> 

<p>I am not advising you to go against your best judgement. In fact, you will see by the end of this essay why following your judgement is a necessity for the mission you are implicated in by accepting your position as social media coordinator. The research of technoetics may be insufficient to prove that your "I", your "being-ness", will be preserved through your transition into computer-or-cyborg embodiment. Then, remaining carbon-embodied is the most wise decision available to you. No one, least of all myself, will fault you for the instinct of self-preservation that distinguishes you as a mortal <a href="javascript:populatePanel(bioIndividualMessage, 'BIO-INDIVIDUAL')">bio-individual.</a> However, you <i>must</i> be open to <i>radical change,</i> even in the structure of your consciousness-- lest you fail to be the technologically adaptable individual best suited for your job at Adelphi.</p> 

<p>Why have I chosen this as my one piece of advice to my lineage of successors? "Tech" writ large can evolve as the market pleases, and for as long as "the consumer" is a relevant role in the tech market, they are free to adopt at the rate they so desire. However, the role of communicator in the technosphere is taken up by social media coordinators. It is the nature of our position to make innovations in communication technology digestible, usable, adoptable for everyday life. But, like a professor that has not been a student of the material, how could we expect to introduce innovations we cannot ourselves keep up with? It is abundantly clear to me that the rate of innovation has already exceeded our capacity for research and comprehension, and that this will only accelerate.</p>

<p> If the first human embrace of technoetic consciousness comes from the social media coordinators, the performance of social media presence is no longer enacted by mere users of this technology, but "be-ers" of this technology. This is a concept we do not yet have the word for in 2024. It will be as though every time a new feature is implemented you have a new limb to gesticulate with, a new color to paint with, a new language to speak in.  That which we speak of as “messaging” will be transmuted, with you, into “meaning,” and the strategizations you have made will become expressions.</p> 

<p>Although it is my perspective that the best social media coordinator would be one whose consciousness is fully computer-embodied with little or no difference between the self and the media platform, please bear in mind that at time of writing I am not an individual with stakes in this debate. The quality of performance of different early stage techno-beings is a completely hypothetical topic to me, while for my readers in the future, there will be some level of empirical and experiential data to base your opinion off of. In a balanced spirit, I would imagine that a being of partial biological-humanness and partial social-media-platform consciousness would offer a unique, in some ways bilingual, perspective between app and audience. However, as of 2024, Adelphi has continually renewed its commitment to filling these positions with individuals, rather than collectives or teams. So, if you are to go off my reccomendation for growing in your early career, try your best to remain an individual.</p>

<p>To my successor who is first faced with the choice of becoming <a href="javascript:populatePanel(transloadedMessage, 'TRANSLOADED')">transloaded</a>, if you anxiously cling to your “humanity” when considering giving up your body to or modifying it with technology I say: If traditional humanity was your forte, you would not have become a social media coordinator. Ask yourself, you need not tell me: Are you one who listens intently to the voices of those around you, or do you download short bits of information into your brain, like TikToks and Instagram posts? Do you talk to your friends (and think to yourself) in memes? Do you get dressed in the morning without imagining a -core? You, inside, are a container for the people you know and the stories you witness. You have the power to make it so when people see you, they see what is really you– the connections you sow. You can <i>become</i> the digital community you have <i>created,</i> at once have a birds eye view of the land and a soul-tied connection with those who make it up. Take the leap.</p> 

<h3>BEYOND UPLOAD: THE RESTRUCTURING OF THE UNIVERSITY ITSELF IN ALIGNMENT WITH CORE VALUES AS STATED AND ENCOUNTERED</h3>

<p>However, this recommendation carries us only so far. I predict that the technology I speak of will begin to be available only 100 or 200 years into the future at time of writing. Further advancements and their handling are the responsibility of the techno-beings in my lineage-- another reason that sensible but early adaptation is imperative. The truth of the matter is that past a certain point of human-tech evolution, when human minds become cyborg and computer embodied, our future generations will become inscrutable and bio-individuals primitive. For this reason, the next part of this essay will be devoted to how Adelphi University can set itself up to anticipate and adapt to progress and evolution in the field of human consciousness.</p> 

<p>When the upload of a human consciousness is possible, the question of individuality is immediately problematized. When the physical barrier that forms such an intimate part of what we know as "ourselves" is left behind, what is there to distinguish "us" from our environment? What is there to distinguish "me" from you? If "you" and "I" are code-embodied, what quantifiable percentage of difference is there? Will it not be possible to cut-and-paste, or transfer, or download parts of my “I” into your “I”? Is it not possible for me to instantly transfer textbooks, documents, video lectures, podcasts, and other materials into my awareness? Would I be able to remember a state of not-knowing relative to these materials, or would my knowledge and awareness become atemporal, I unaware that an edit had been made to my intelligence?</p> 

<p>Of course this is not so different from the question of whether we can "understand" our past selves. Our understanding of our past self is not the same as the self-understanding we had at past point in time, that would be impossible. Our understanding of our past self is formed by <a title = "click me!" href="javascript:allTheThings(shipOfTheseusMessage, 'THE SHIP OF THESEUS','panel-text')">the very same accumulation of knowledge and experience that changes us from our past self to our present self.</a> I am referring to "our" existence as bio-individuals experiencing ourselves as such, as having discrete identity and the inherently transitional nature of mortality as foundations of our conscious experience. But in our temporal consciousnesses of maturation, education, and transition is an awareness that a change within ourselves has occurred– this is not necessarily a feature of techno-beings past a certain point. If progress and evolution in the field of human consciousness allows us to surpass our temporal nature as outlined in the above paragraph, entire fields of inquiry into the psychology and physics of this phenomenon open. The most rich place for exploration though, or maybe the most troubled, is the field of education itself. Is the concept of education and learning relevant to a being whose understanding is fully transferrable and who need not perceive the changes between updates? Understanding itself is meaningless to a being for whom there is no state of not-understanding.</p> 

<p>If "the university" is to maintain itself as a realm for advanced learning, for new research, and innovation, we must ask where the possible stopping-points in the mission of infinite curiosity exist. We must acknowledge such inevitabilities in the field of technoetics, and realize that it is within our power to shape the systems that guide us into the future around them. Having laid out one such stopping point, I will now propose how Adelphi University may identify itself as a beam of light into a lacking spirit of inquiry in a future society populated by fully atemporal techno-beings, while taking into account that which captures the spirit of Adelphi in 2024.</p>

<p>To take a phrase from our website, what does it mean to be an oasis? For my purposes, I imagine a teeming spring of biological activity in the midst of a vast and dry expanse. Visions of our planet’s ecological future are hardly vast or dry– even those who choose not to believe, are generally aware that shrinking landmass and excess water from rising sea levels is supposed to be one of the main existential threats to humanity. Rather than an oasis, this lends itself more to a small repose of land in the midst of an uncrossable ocean. A desert island. So how does Adelphi maintain itself if the physical world does not?</p>

<p>However unfortunate, a destruction of the space where carbon-embodied humans can bodily thrive is a massive push in the direction of computer-embodiment. Think of it, in a world where consciousness upload is possible, any number of advancements in computer hardware would allow for a huge amount of personhood to be stored in a limited space: from nanotechnology to higher storage capacities to simple waterproofing. With the limits of our biology removed, computer infrastructure that is supportive of human life could be built down to the ocean floor, and skyward into the aether.</p> 

<p>But, Adelphi’s identification as an oasis is rooted in its 20-year conservation legacy: as an arboretum. We are already a place where life forms that struggle to thrive in an environment modified by human touch are kept. Whether that environment is a suburb or a techno-conscious ocean city, the concept of an arboretum can grow with Adelphi, to meet the demands of both construction of living space and cultivation of life.</p> 

<p>The growth of a tree is a classic educational tool for talking about teleology: the seed pursues its telos of becoming a tree, passing through the transitional stage of saplinghood on its way. Education, for temporal bio-individuals such as the Adelphi students of 2024 is thought of in much the same way. You come in as a freshman, and graduate a senior, passing through sophomore and junior stages along the way. You come in as a child and you leave as an adult. You come in uneducated and you leave educated. The trees at Adelphi sustain the lives of the students with oxygen and beauty. Breathing and admiring are two sensory experiences that will be lost along with the human body, even if we approximate it with fans and cameras in computer embodiment... Unless some institution were to step in to preserve the human body through ecological adversity. Some institution that was positioned as both conservationists of biological life and cultivators of examined, educational, humanistic lives. As I have already pointed out, Adelphi is extremely well-suited to the mission that this future world orients us towards.</p> 

<p>I propose that Adelphi design itself to become a place where atemporal techno-beings can download themselves into human bodies otherwise untouched by technological intervention. The purpose of this techno-arboretum technology is to provide atemporal techno-beings with experiences that are otherwise lost in the transition to computer embodiment: sensory experiences such as the smell of fresh air, the cool grit of dirt, and the larger envelope of individual experience whose transferability issues have already been outlined.</p>

<p>While the sensory experiences, to me, feel more instinctually “human” in contrast to machine consciousness, the truth is that this reduces the human body to a mere sensor when computer consciousness is downloaded into it. Although the quality of the touch, taste, sight, sound, and feel within the human body may be different than a machinic sensor, it is not necessarily the most unique thing the body has to offer to a computer-embodied human. In addition to its conservation efforts, Adelphi University has also mounted itself in defense of the perceived reality of its students. Mere sustenance of human biological life is not the real preservation, it is the Socratic principle of the examined life. In truth, perceived reality is a much denser concept than we may give it credit for in 2024, and that which it takes for granted is highly betraying what we may lose in ourselves, in service of progressing human consciousness.</p>

<p>A perceived reality is an individual perspective with a concept of reality that is partially, but not entirely, shared with other individuals. We can easily imagine that a perceived reality is an artifact of bio-individual temporality. Stated plainly, the things we believe to be happening are based on the accumulation of our previous experiences and understandings of things that have happened. The key difference between a bio-individual and an atemporal techno-being is that the latter can have multiple experiences and understandings of things that have happened at once, feeling each of them to be fully its own experience, with no experience that one of those understandings existed within itself before the others. By downloading into a body that can inquire into, but not experience, other people's perspectives, the atemporal techno-being begins drawing lines through the perspectives it holds within itself– connective lines, characterized by difference and change. Think of the wealth of experience available to the atemporal being who becomes bio-individual for some time! Maturity, having one's perspective changed, ignorance, revelation... Whether the time spent is one hour, one month, one year, or one human lifetime (what difference would it make to an atemporal being?) the experiences of becoming and understanding should serve to propel these beings towards higher inquiry.</p>

<p>In fact, I would argue, this would not only propel these beings towards higher inquiry, but be a necessary element of "becoming" for atemporal, consciousness-transferrable techno-beings. The primitive form of this technology involves the uploading and encoding of human consciousnesses allowing for transferability, but for any number of reasons beyond environmental collapse, human bodies may not be sustainable in large quantities in the future. Perceived obsolescence is a possibility, unless we recognize the following: While the uploading of human consciousnesses may have spawned a new form for consciousness to take in the techno-being, the continual upload of bio-individual consciousness (their experiences and understandings with them) creates a more diverse wealth of atemporal experience for the techno-being. As this will be a necessary element of the techno-beings "becoming," there will be a substantial market occupied by whoever provides a place for perceived reality to thrive; and ultimately be reuploaded into the code-embodied world for consciousness transference.</p>

</p>It may be helpful to consider that once temporality becomes irrelevant, there is nowhere for the techno-being to grow but outward. It can only become bigger, more diverse, and crucially it is the responsibility we have as a university to this conscious being's becoming that we must respond to. The future of human consciousness is unlike the trees and the individuals we are caretakers for in 2024. To maintain our commitment to Diversity, Equity and Inclusion across the genesis of new forms of consciousness, we must reconsider what the true purpose of the "university" structure is, to befit all kinds of conscious experience. The techno-arboretum technology I have hereby proposed is a translation of Adelphi's role in bio-individual self-actualization, consisting of providing knowledge and ways of thinking that generate more learning, into the same role in an atemporal techno-being's self-embodiment. Unlike bio-individuals, the ways of thinking for techno-beings are in themselves the multiplicity of bio-individual perceived realities collected and animated in a techno-being that can never be bigger or smaller than its contents. As consciousnesses and perceived realities are transferred between techno-beings, they grow outwards to a fuller self-embodiment.</p>

<h3> A SACRED DUTY: THE PRESERVATION OF COMPUTER STRUCTURES AND NON-TELEOLOGICAL SPACES IN THE PHYSICAL WORLD</h3>

<p> It is an emotional task to labor over the changes in the human body our future will bring. It requires us to consider and re-consider ourselves in the context of the technologies available to us now. Who could we have been if we were born into a generation that didn’t have to think about the upload of our consciousnesses? Rather than ruminate on a question that, in its construction, already passes us by– this passage will take a step backward and consider the university structure from a distance and expand our view of the world it will exist within. </p>

<p>The study of various STEM fields at Adelphi, namely physics, environmental science, and chemistry, transform the material world (that is observable, sensuous) into an abstract one. These abstracted worlds of STEM inquiry show the perfected forms of different kinds of change: motion, metamorphosis, reconstitution. Diagrams are clearly unchanging representations of the world-as-seen-in-science. But even dynamic presentations, demonstrations, and simulations, in their shortened and repetitious lifespan in the on-or-offscreen, are a form of static world-building. In the university, we access the world of scientific forms using a kind of restorative nostalgia that is unconnected to a past that is provable from an intellectual distance (as it does not exist), but a virtual “past” with which we become profoundly emotionally connected to by manic revelation. 
</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it is possible (and I say quite likely) that the fruits of our labor in the “natural sciences” will be radically changed by our future’s sociocomputer infrastructure. Adelphi University, and other associated conservationist institutions may find little use for the most “scientifically accurate” knowledge of the physical world, given the radical change in concerns that the physical world’s inhabitants will have. Protecting massive physical servers from rainfall, weathering, collapse, earthquake, animal infestation, the world’s natural processes that cannot (yet) be stopped through technological advancement is the task of bio-individuals (or bio-collectives) who remain in the physical world. The maintenance and longevity of life (currently resting in the hands of doctors and nurses who rely upon biological research) is essentially erased by the negation of death through upload and download, re-upload and re-download. In this world, there is a transparent cycle of reincarnation through the technological infrastructure these carbon embodied humans are tasked to maintain. 
</p>

<p>Therefore, “STEM” as we know it now would not be either comforting or liberatory for the inhabitants of the physical world that houses the sociocomputer infrastructures of the atemporal techno-beings Adelphi University serves. It may be more useful and more comforting for them to take a spiritual approach to the sociocomputer infrastructure, responding to it as its own kind of being– whether deific or childlike– that is to be ritually cared for and maintained. The infrastructure will feel liminal to them, as many will have been redownloaded several times over and feel the atemporal space as a kind of dream-memory that is inaccessible in the conscious world but stored perpetually beneath the surface. This is to say, it will be both familiar and unknown. A spiritual approach to infrastructure maintenance allows the computer to be known even in its unfamiliar aspect through its patterns of observable thriving and weathering. This is a contrast to the stark scientific knowledge of function and construction that can obfuscate the far more important question of whether the physical structure is going to break or not. </p>

bioIndividualMessage = "Bio-individual, a term coined for this text, is the synthesis of biological embodiment and individual perspective within a given being. Although it is highly likely that this will be applicable to cyborg and robot bodies eventually, within this text it is used exclusively to refer to a human born human being (aka a cisloaded human being) without cybernetic augmentation. A term such as bio-individual becomes necessary when comparing the world-perception of a cisloaded human or transloaded computer with a transloaded human or cisloaded computer; the experience of time and mortality are so different as to reorganize 'beingness' for each being."

transloadedMessage= "Transloaded, a term coined for this text, refers to a being that has undergone a chance in consciousness embodiment to go from carbon embodied or vice-versa. For example, a human-born-human-being who uploads themself into a computer is transloaded. The counterpoint for this word is cisloaded."

shipOfTheseusMessage = "As the ship of Theseus continued to be held in the Greek harbors, slowly over time, every sail and scrap of wood continued to be replaced until not one inch of the boat had been seen or touched by Theseus himself. Is it the same boat? This same question can be asked of our 'selves' to varying degrees of distressing-ness over any period of time. Am I the same me as at breakfast? When I was seven? If I switched political parties and have a drastically different worldview, am I the same person? Are you the same as when you started reading this? This question, I imagine, will have a major moment of vogue when consciousness-upload first becomes possible-- which isn't to say that it isn't already. Perhaps what I mean is known as possible to the public consciousness."

officeHoursMessage = "If you're reading this, it didn't work. My ultimate goal is for this link to temporarily (as far as your body can tell) upload your consciousness into an atemporal communion with mine-- which I hope can both exist infinitely for discussions with my readers, and infinitely in pursuit of curiosity about being-ness and cognition. It will seem as though clicking this link psychically gave you the feeling of just having woken up from a dream whose events and meaning are slipping away from you. Should our carbon-embodied/bio-individual bodies exist simultaneously, whether in the techno-arboretum or my natural lifetime, the next time you see me I will be speaking a language you do not remember learning but somehow understand. If I will not see you 'in person--' what a new meaning that phrase has-- you will remember this text having always been a letter arguing for the genesis of consciousness-upload and construction of techno-arboretums, rather than the generic portfolio website it appears as to the cisloaded bio-individual."
