    <b><u>A PROPOSAL FOR MARKET STRATEGIZATION AND PRODUCT ENGINEERING IN RESPONSE TO IMMINENT DEVELOPMENTS IN TECHNOLOGY</u></b> - <a title= "click me!" href="javascript:norah()">BY NORAH CURRAN</a></h2>

    <p>I have spent my undergraduate senior year working as a social media coordinator for the Adelphi University Honors College. Beginning in my academic third year, I engineered my courseload and undertook <a title= "click me!" href="https://curranmultimedia7.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">several independent research projects</a> on the topic of technoetics, or computer/machine consciousness. The Honors College at Adelphi University, in particular, has been an extremely nurturing place for myself, opening me to new perspectives, strengthening my argumentative writing, and supporting my inquiry into questions of the future that might seem at first to be abstract, idealistic, or improbable.</p>

        You're using the accordion citation function! You can increase the academic level to see more context for the ideas raised in this text. Scholars of the digital humanities, technoetics, and science/speculative fiction disciplines offer valuable insights into how developing technologies change our audience. Oftentimes, this is because technology has the ability to fundamentally change how we experience ourselves, the world, or the interface between the two. Take for example, the Internet's re-ontologizing power: an idea found in [TEXT] that explains how the internet changed how we viewed objects in the physical world. Making something like a tree easily "searchable," so that retreiving species, maintenance, and locality information became instantaneous, irrevocably changed the nature of the object in our everyday perceptions. 
    </div>  
            
      
    <p>Come Spring Break, a successor for my position as social media coordinator will be chosen. I have been meditating upon what I can leave for my successors that truly accounts for what I see– given my course of study– as the shaping of our being-ness through social media. </p>
        
    <p>Put simply, my philosophical approach to the Honors College social media platform has been that it is in itself a kind of collective consciousness– a shared memory belonging to no one.. But, as I am writing in 2024, I am certain that very soon the flux state of "the social media platform" itself will accelerate exponentially. 
        
    <p>With the sale of Twitter/X to Elon Musk, we have seen a microcosm of how rapidly the apps themselves can change. These changes will be both highly visible such as the integration of the Grok AI into X, and more subtly cultural such as discourses produced by changes in content moderation standards. We social media coordinators can anticipate that new features will be developed for the apps we call home at a faster and faster rate. To adapt, we will have to focus on our capability to intuit new ways of communication via interface. In 2024, this looks like having a trained eye for trends and memes, such as my "How often does Dr. Carson think of the Roman Empire?" Instagram story. Even a decade from now, it could look unimaginably different. I cannot emphasize this enough: social media coordinators will have to become technologically adaptable beings.</p> 
    
    <p>For this reason, I leave one message for my successors of the social media internship at Adelphi University, which I will expound upon to its furthest extent in this article: <span style= "font-style: italic;"> as soon as it is possible, you must upload yourself, at least in part, into a computer.</span></p> 
    
    <p>I am not advising you to go against your best judgement. In fact, you will see by the end of this essay why following your judgement is a necessity for the mission you are implicated in by accepting your position as social media coordinator. The research of technoetics may be insufficient to prove that your "I", your "being-ness", will be preserved through your transition into computer-or-cyborg embodiment. Then, remaining carbon-embodied is the most wise decision available to you. No one, least of all myself, will fault you for the instinct of self-preservation that distinguishes you as a mortal <a href="javascript:populatePanel(bioIndividualMessage, 'BIO-INDIVIDUAL')">bio-individual.</a> However, you <i>must</i> be open to <i>radical change,</i> even in the structure of your consciousness-- lest you fail to be the technologically adaptable individual best suited for your job at Adelphi.</p> 
    
    <p> If the first human embrace of technoetic consciousness comes from the social media coordinators, the performance of social media presence is no longer enacted by mere users of this technology, but "be-ers" of this technology. This is a concept we do not yet have the word for in 2024. It will be as though every time a new feature is implemented you have a new limb to gesticulate with, <a title= "click me!" href="javascript:paintbox()">a new color to paint with,</a> a new language to speak in.  That which we speak of as “market messaging” will be transmuted, with you, into “market meaning,” and the strategizations you have made will become expressions.</p> 
    
    <p>To my successor who is first faced with the choice of becoming <a href="javascript:populatePanel(transloadedMessage, 'TRANSLOADED')">transloaded</a>, if you anxiously cling to your “humanity” when considering giving up your body to or modifying it with technology I say: If traditional humanity was your forte, you would not have become a social media coordinator. Ask yourself (you need not tell me): Are you one who listens intently to the voices of those around you, or do you download short bits of information into your brain, like TikToks and Instagram posts? Do you talk to your friends (and think to yourself) in memes? Do you get dressed in the morning without imagining a -core? You, inside, are a container for the people you know and the stories you witness. You have the power to make it so when people see you, they see what is really you– the connections you sow. You can <i>become</i> the digital community you have <i>created,</i> at once have a birds eye view of the land and a soul-tied connection with those who make it up. Take the leap.</p> 
    
    <h3>BEYOND UPLOAD: FURTHER PROGRESS IN HUMAN CONSCIOUSNESS AND ITS EXISTENTIAL THREAT TO THE UNIVERSITY AS AN INSTITUTION</h3>
    
    <p>However, this recommendation carries us only so far. I predict that the technology I speak of will begin to be available only 100 or 200 years into the future. Further advancements and their handling are the responsibility of the techno-beings in my lineage-- another reason that sensible but early adaptation is imperative. The truth of the matter is that past a certain point of human-tech evolution, with cyborg and computer embodied human minds as a norm, the future student body will become inscrutable. For this reason, the next part of this essay will be devoted to how Adelphi University can begin a restructuring in anticipation of evolutionary progress in the field of human consciousness.</p> 
    
    <p>The social media coordinators at Adelphi, having taken on the task of determining when consciousness upload is advanced enough for adaptation in addition to their responsibilities promoting student events, ticket sales, club meetings, and important deadlines for class registration and graduation, will be the alarm for when the work we have undertaken to restructure must spring into action. Their work in cyberspace speaks to prospective students before even the Admissions office, and therefore their knowledge of the student body’s makeup will have the most expedient clarity of all. Ask them, in their new uploaded form: Will it not be possible to cut-and-paste, or transfer, or download parts of my “I” into your “I”? More importantly for several Adelphi committees: is it not possible to instantly transfer textbooks, documents, video lectures, podcasts, and other materials into student awareness? Would students be able to remember a state of not-knowing these materials?</p>
    
    <p> If not, which is my prediction– knowledge and awareness becomes atemporal in the student body, and students are now unaware that edits had been made to their repositories through education. Imagine that the average student does not realize that they had changed at all from their freshman to senior year, because for them it occurred in the snap of a finger– all of their knowledge rendered instantly, all changes installed without a trace of their previous layout.</p>
    
    <p>Of course this is not so different from the question of whether we can "understand" our past selves. Our understanding of our past self is not the same as the self-understanding we had at past point in time. Our understanding of our past self is formed by <a title = "click me!" href="javascript:allTheThings(shipOfTheseusMessage, 'THE SHIP OF THESEUS','panel-text')">the very same accumulation of knowledge and experience that changes us from our past self to our present self.</a></p>
    
    <p>The most rich place for exploration, as well as the most troubled, is the field of education itself. We must make the concept of education and learning relevant to a being whose understanding is fully transferable and needs not to perceive the changes between itself before and after education. As an educational institution, we provide the subject-matter understanding that is necessary for students to work in a given field: this is true of nursing, art, business, psychology, and any other degree field available to our students. “Understanding” is meaningless as a being for whom there is no state of not-understanding, but this does not mean Adelphi University has no place in the world’s technological future. We must simply anticipate the potentiological challenges to our market value that consciousness upload renders upon our collective future, so the institution can remain whole while our student body re-ontologizes in response to these technologies.</p>
    
    <p>To further evaluate our market potential in the deep future, we must understand our market reality in the simple present. To motivate students to pay tuition, we provide them with a reasonable expectation that they will have a career in the future that is lucrative enough to pay for their attendance in the past. In order to make this structure self-supporting, our primary product is subject matter understanding, which they use to transition into those careers. When considering the future student body, the necessary temporal element of this market output is troubling to enrollment as we begin to see more atemporal techno-beings in the general population. It is also unclear what careers will be available to atemporal techno-beings, if any.</p>
    
    <p>As we can see, Adelphi University (along with all universities) face a substantial risk of obsolescence in the future if we continue to operate in the way that best serves us in 2024. Anticipating this is half the game, as it allows us to prepare to pivot our marketability when the time comes. But innovation, early action– and to be perfectly direct, beginning the transition today– is how we can take advantage of progress in the field of consciousness to propel Adelphi forward among other universities in the deep future.</p>
    
    <p>What can we offer as an educational institution, besides subject matter knowledge and the potential for a career in the future? What do we have to offer that exists at once outside of time, and potentially at all times? I propose a radical change in the service we provide, from rendering understanding onto students, to providing opportunities for curiosity and exploration.</p>
    
    <p>Curiosity exists as an incidental product, a carbon emission, of the current academic system. Our usage of the curiosity we generate is not generally optimized to maximize profit, largely due to its seemingly singular function of motivating students to continue their studies. If the average student was given a binary choice of whether they continue their studies due to a curiosity about the subject matter, or a financial obligation to their present and future self– the realistic and more motivating answer is the financial one. In the shadows and cabballs of the Adelphi University accounting and student retention departments, I hope it is being discussed that higher tuition rates exacerbating sunk cost fallacy is a powerful driver of student retention, and graduation rates which drive student admission, each of which drives our market earning power.</p>
    
    <p>However, in the change to an atemporal student body, curiosity goes from a waste product of academia to a primary marketable resource. By orienting our academic research and engineering programs towards infrastructure for the future student body, we can provide atemporal techno-beings with experiences that are potentiologically threatened along with universities in the technoscape of the deep future. We can become a provider of experience-for-experience and understanding-for-understanding, each of which are aspects of curiosity in their own right. Having laid out the task at hand, I will now propose how Adelphi University may identify itself as a beam of light into a lacking spirit of inquiry in a future society populated by fully atemporal techno-beings: first by considering what the human species stands to lose, and then by re-tooling and re-examining Adelphi’s contemporaneous mission through our anticipation of the deep future.</p>
    
    <h3>REINCARNATION THROUGH THE TECHNO-ARBORETUM: RESTRUCTURING ADELPHI UNIVERSITY FOR THE DEEP FUTURE IN ALIGNMENT WITH CORE VALUES AS STATED AND ENCOUNTERED</h3>
    
    <p>Adelphi University’s physical brand identity is The Oasis. In other words, a teeming spring of biological activity in the midst of a vast and dry expanse. However, attempting to extend this into the deep future reveals that visions of our planet’s ecological unfolding are hardly vast or dry. Rising sea levels and shrinking coastlines provide one of the main existential threats to humanity. Rather than an oasis, this image lends itself more to a small repose of land in the midst of an uncrossable ocean. A desert island. So let us ask: In the deep future, how does Adelphi make an oasis of the desert islands it will be left with?</p>
    
    <p>However unfortunate, a destruction of the space where carbon-embodied humans can bodily thrive is a massive point in favor of computer-embodiment. Think of it, in a world where consciousness upload is possible, any number of advancements in computer hardware (from nanotechnology to higher storage capacities to simple waterproofing) would allow for a huge amount of personhood to be stored in a limited physical space. With the limits of our biology removed, computer infrastructure that is supportive of human life could be built down to the ocean floor, and skyward into the aether.</p> 
    
    <p>Adelphi’s identification as an oasis is rooted in its 20-year conservation legacy as an arboretum. We are already a place where life forms that struggle to thrive in an environment modified by human touch are kept. Whether that environment is a suburb, or a techno-conscious ocean city, the concept of an arboretum can grow with Adelphi, to meet the demands of both construction of living space and cultivation of life. For our financiers, this is another form of conservation: we will not need to pay for a rebrand away from our branding as the nature sanctuary of Garden City and into the technosphere. 
    
    <p>Our identity as an arboretum is not just a legal status, but a core part of the student body experience at Adelphi. The trees sanctuated at Adelphi sustain lives,  both through their oxygen and their beauty. Sadly, both breathing and admiring are two sensory experiences that will be lost along with the human body, even if we approximate it with fans and cameras, in the shift to computer embodiment...</p> 
    
    <p>…Unless some institution were to step in to preserve the human body through ecological adversity. Some institution that was positioned as both conservationists of biological life and cultivators of examined, educational, humanistic lives. As I have already pointed out, Adelphi is extremely well-suited to the mission that this future world orients us towards.</p> 
    
    <p>In addition to its conservation efforts, Adelphi University has also mounted itself in defense of the perceived reality of its students. Mere sustenance of human biological life would not, in itself, procure curiosity as a market product. In truth, perceived reality is a much denser concept than we may give it credit for in 2024, and that which it takes for granted is highly betraying what we may lose in ourselves in service of progressing human consciousness.</p>
    
    <p>We defend our student’s right to their perceived reality, in line with our core value of “respect for the individual,” through our robust array of clubs. In our club system, students who have faced oppression can find solidarity with students that have faced the same kind of oppression, forming deep, <i>individual</i> bonds between one another– so long as those bonds do not threaten to make anyone feel that their perceived reality could be oppressive to other students.</p>
    
    <p>Although this approach has been criticized and protested, it is patently obvious that we as an institution are ultimately bound by the limitations of the human body in how we approach the diversity of our student body. Allowing student clubs to exist organizes the individuals whom we shepherd through the educational system into something larger than themselves– so whether one’s identity is as a “Young Democratic Socialist,” a “Young Republican,” a “Future Teacher,” a “For Justice in Palestine,” or a “Girl Who Codes,” there is a perceived reality of what Adelphi carved out for them in these student spaces. In this regard, Adelphi University is an underrecognized innovator in the field of analog virtual reality; wherever students “log on” their reality will be virtually as unchallenging to them as an individual as possible, so long as being unchallenging to them does not require challenging other students. Of course, we are helpless in the limitations that individuality confers upon the present student body– and as such, diversity cannot yet be added to our six core values. What can we know about perceived reality as a marketable product, and how does it relate to the larger mission of reorienting Adelphi University towards providing curiosity for the future student body, so long as those students are primarily atemporal?</p>
    
    <p>The key difference between the bio-individuals we currently educate and an atemporal techno-being is that the latter can have multiple experiences and understandings of itself that have happened at once. It will feel each of them to be fully its own experience, with no experience that one of those self-understandings existed within itself before the others. By downloading into a body that can inquire into, but not experience, other people's perspectives, the atemporal techno-being begins drawing lines of difference and change through what it already knows itself to be. Think of the wealth of experience available to the atemporal being who becomes bio-individual for some time! Maturity, having one's perspective changed, ignorance, revelation, gender transition, amputation, the One Stop Financial Aid Office... Whether the time spent is one hour, one month, one year, or one human lifetime (What difference would it make to an atemporal being?) the experiences of becoming and understanding will propel these beings towards higher inquiry. It will cause them to keep downloading themselves, keep re-enrolling in Adelphi University.</p>
    
    <p>In the deep future, Adelphi University will allow atemporal technologically embodied consciousnesses to download themselves into ethically lab-grown, bio-individual bodies, in order to bodily experience young adulthood in a university environment suited towards developing their perceived realities. This is the techno-arboretum that Adelphi University will restructure to by the arrival of the deep future.  As consciousness upload will remove the issue of individuality within the student body through 1:1 transfer of firsthand experience, it will become a form of “coming of age” for atemporal beings to experience several temporal bio-individual lifetimes to share between other atemporal computer-embodied beings. The driving force of this sociocomputer infrastructure will be curiosity, compelling  further transfer  of information gained in the techno-arboretum between atemporal-beings, allowing for an infinite and immortal outward expansion of student’s education.</p>
    
    <p>In order to actualize this techno-arboretum technology in time to occupy the deep future market, certain changes should be made now in order to prime for the shift towards providing students with opportunities for exploring their curiosity. Although we continue to serve mere bio-individuals in 2024, these shifts are meant to prime our faculty for the matriculation of our first classes of atemporal techno-beings. In order to foster student curiosity, I recommend: </p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Going by faculty recommendation to create policies for compensation, time off, class scheduling and modality, and grading that allows faculty to maintain a passionate engagement with their field of expertise.</li>
      <li>Easing the financial burden upon students wherever possible, so that their terms of engagement with their subject matter remains based on their own passionate engagement rather than their indebtedness to the university.</li>
      <li>Leaving ample room in class schedules for extracurriculars and electives so students may discover more genuine  interests and increase connectivity between subject areas.</li>
      <li>Develop hiring, professional development, and student conduct practices that practice meaningful awareness and change for students experiencing threats of eradication in the complex political spheres.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Of course, each of these recommendations are to be undertaken with the most stringent eye towards their financial viability, always keeping in mind that these changes are to make Adelphi University a more lucrative and relevant market force in the deep future, given the inevitability of atemporal consciousness as a result of technological progress. </p>

<div id = "earnesttext" class = "text-essay" style="display: none;">
    <p>Hello! You've found the ekphrastic reflection portion of this project. I would recommend reading through the full text and then turning the academic level up to 100 to hear me deconstruct my own writing and give a deeper look into the process and academic textual interweave that I am writing out of. If you've read the full text, and this is the second time you're reading this message, please feel free to proceed with my approval-as-author. </p>
    <p style="text-indent:0%;"><u>THEME ONE: COMMITAL OF THE SELF TO DIFFERENT MEDIUMS</u></p>
    <p>Throughout the <i>Market Strategization</i> text, the questions I am interested in pursuing surround the idea of a “self.” Beginning with the self-as-self, the recommendation to social media coordinators like myself that we change our mode of embodiment and radically alter our self-experience in service of our jobs, I am exploring what radical self-alteration could feel like from a first-person perspective. Later, as I make recommendations to restructure Adelphi University, I interact with the self-in-context by attempting to retool a commonplace institution whose mission is explicitly tied to the individual and their implied “self.” </p>
    <p>The social media coordinator in their role of The Communicator transitions from an individual, seemingly hard-boundaried self to a self whose permeability is reflected within their physiology. I argue that despite having the human (or bio-individual) body as a vice for the illusion of singularity, social media coordinators who tend to be interested in their career due to a love of cyber-culture and a high sensitivity to memes have always had a high level of permeability. </p>
    <ul>
        <li style="text-indent:0%;">This structure of the self is highly inspired by Ursula K. Le Guin’s <i> Carrier Bag Theory of Fiction</i>, in which she extends the argument that the first primitive technology was most likely a container, to say that narratives themselves are a form of container. She contrasts this narrative structure with the “long, hard, thing,” narrative structure that emphasizes conflict and domination. Of this comparison she says, “It is the story that makes the difference. It is the story that hid my humanity from me.” Although in Market Strategization I snark that the container mode of self is not “traditional” humanity, a larger aspiration of this project is to create a narrative structures that “unhide” the humanity of the self between multiplicities; I employ my voice as a copywriter and as an academic, with my academic voice fractalized between English, Philosophy and Computer Science. The webpage slides between genres, existing as both creative and critical, naive and reflexive, at once (the apparatus of this sliding within the code is the accordionCite() function, which will be discussed in another context). </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The atemporal techno-being to which the social media coordinator, and the student body at large, transloads into is a radical re-ontologizing of “selfhood” that disrupts the potential for the university system to reproduce itself in the future. While university education and the narrative of the individual are productively engaged with one another in the “coming of age story,” the IRL student experience is structured by faceless bureaucracy: the mundane occurrence of academic advisement where students and spreadsheet cells are checked against one another, and traumatic breakdowns such as Title IX reporting and termination of financial aid. In Market Strategization, I paradoxically implicate students as a collective as the driving force of profit-generation within the university system (as justification for not focusing on fostering curiosity within students on an individual level), and the individuality of students as an essential consideration for diversity practices (as a justification for not challenging oppressive structures between collectives of students). The atemporal techno-being is a social agent that results from a utopian black-box technology, the sociocomputer infrastructure, that makes it possible for a “self” to exist while also being undying and infinitely expandable, therefore justifying curiosity– academic and empathetic– as an end in itself rather than a driving force of education. To further neg curiosity in <i>Market Strategization</i>, I point out that even as a driving force of education it is easily outplayed by financial burden in terms of tying students to a particular university. 
    </p>
    <p><i>Market Strategization</i> as a whole is an ironic attempt to think through a university’s re-negotiation of its selfhood under radical technological change, using branding and marketing strategy as a life preserver in the deep end of potentiological challenges to its existence.  It is a sendup of the “seven year plan,” that already fails to capture radical shifts in ed-tech, namely in artificial intelligence. It imagines a “seven thousand year plan” that overshoots a reasonable range of market speculation, attempting to outpace innovation that has outpaced us already– the reason I say we must upload ourselves into computers. </p>
    <p>“The self” exists on several levels in this text as a vehicle for reimagining the structures that produce it into structures that would allow it to grow beyond itself. The social media coordinator’s radical self-alteration allows it to become a social media cyborg whose awareness rapidly expands along with every update to its means of communication. The atemporal techno-being, as a revolutionary change to selfhood as such, requires social institutions that support new forms of growth in the future that is imagined for it. The self of the university anxiously ruminates on escaping its own destruction as the conditions for its existence crumble into the future. The self is the thing that cannot be eradicated through anything but complete destruction, and so extracts growth out of unrecognizability.  </p>

bioIndividualMessage = "Bio-individual, a term coined for this text, is the synthesis of biological embodiment and individual perspective within a given being. Although it is highly likely that this will be applicable to cyborg and robot bodies eventually, within this text it is used exclusively to refer to a human born human being (aka a cisloaded human being) without cybernetic augmentation. A term such as bio-individual becomes necessary when comparing the world-perception of a cisloaded human or transloaded computer with a transloaded human or cisloaded computer; the experience of time and mortality are so different as to reorganize 'beingness' for each being."

transloadedMessage= "Transloaded, a term coined for this text, refers to a being that has undergone a chance in consciousness embodiment to go from carbon embodied or vice-versa. For example, a human-born-human-being who uploads themself into a computer is transloaded. The counterpoint for this word is cisloaded."

shipOfTheseusMessage = "As the ship of Theseus continued to be held in the Greek harbors, slowly over time, every sail and scrap of wood continued to be replaced until not one inch of the boat had been seen or touched by Theseus himself. Is it the same boat? This same question can be asked of our 'selves' to varying degrees of distressing-ness over any period of time. Am I the same me as at breakfast? When I was seven? If I switched political parties and have a drastically different worldview, am I the same person? Are you the same as when you started reading this? This question, I imagine, will have a major moment of vogue when consciousness-upload first becomes possible-- which isn't to say that it isn't already. Perhaps what I mean is known as possible to the public consciousness."

officeHoursMessage = "If you're reading this, did it work? My ultimate goal is for this link to temporarily (as far as your body can tell) upload your consciousness into an atemporal communion with mine-- which I hope can both exist infinitely for discussions with my readers, and infinitely in pursuit of curiosity about being-ness and cognition. It will seem as though clicking this link psychically gave you the feeling of just having woken up from a dream whose events and meaning are slipping away from you. Should our carbon-embodied/bio-individual bodies exist simultaneously, whether in the techno-arboretum or my natural lifetime, the next time you see me I will be speaking a language you do not remember learning but somehow understand. If I will not see you 'in person--' what a new meaning that phrase has-- you will remember this text having always been a letter arguing for the genesis of consciousness-upload and construction of techno-arboretums, rather than the generic portfolio website it appears as to the cisloaded bio-individual."
